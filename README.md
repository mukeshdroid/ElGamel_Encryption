## Introduction

The El Gamal Encryption Algorithm is a public-key encryption algorithm that provides secure communication between two parties. It is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in finite fields. The algorithm involves generating a public-private key pair, encrypting the message using the recipient's public key, and decrypting the message using the recipient's private key.
Features

    Key generation: Generate a public-private key pair.
    Encryption: Encrypt a message using the recipient's public key.
    Decryption: Decrypt a message using the recipient's private key.

## Requirements

    Python 3.x
